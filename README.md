WeatherHQ
==============
Spring Boot web application with backend integration to OpenWeatherMap RESTful API

To do
--------------
* Increase test coverage
* Validate accuracy of OpenWeatherMap sunrise and sunset times
* Add simple AngularJS frontend (simple form component that invokes a 'weatherService' which in turn will handle the calls to the API backend via Angular '$http' service).
